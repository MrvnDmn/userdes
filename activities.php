      Hi, my name is Marvin Daniel S. Dimaano, you can call me Marvs or Marvin. 
I live in Imus, Cavite. Since today is the first day of class and it's really early in the morning, I am feeling a little sleepy. 
During the summer this is time where I'm just preparing to go to sleep so my body haven't adjusted to the new schedule yet.
<br><br>
For the summer, I feel like I wasted most of my time, I just spent time playing games, browse the internet, watch movies. 
I didn't really used the time to learn any new skill or at least improve the things I learned during my first year of college.
<br><br>
I really don't like talking about my feelings, I like to keep things to myself.
I don't really like sharing with anyone unless it's someone I'm comfortable with.
<br><br>
My expectation for this subject is how can it be used or relate to the previous programming languages we have learned in the previous year.

	  <h1>REDDIT</h1>
	  <br>
      Reddit is one of the apps that I enjoy using a lot. Though I don&#39;t have the Reddit app on my
phone, I mostly use it on my laptop. Reddit is an online forum/discussion website. I enjoy browsing
reddit a lot, there are a lot of different discussion and it is interesting to read others opinion on certain
topic. You can also view meme pages for fun. I mostly look for theories and similar things when I browse
reddit, but I also enjoy browsing random threads.
	  <br><br>
	  <h1>MANGAREADER</h1>
	  Mangareader is probably my favorite out of all the available manga viewing application. I read
manga a lot, and the app is very convenient because you can use the application for offline and online
viewing. The app allows you to download any manga for offline reading. One feature I like is it allows
you “favorite” a manga and the app will notify you on whether there is a new chapter of the manga in
your “favorites”. There is also a feature where you can select different sources of your manga
	  <br><br>
	  <h1>SPOTIFY</h1>
	  Spotify is an audio streaming platform. It allows the user to listen music and different podcast. One
feature I like that it gives you recommendations of new artist based on the genre that you’ve been
listening. Though you need to have the premium version of the app to enjoy the fully enjoy the
application. When you use the free version, you get ads in between songs and you can’t select a specific
song you want.

          Activity #3: 1000 Floor Elevator
        </button>

    <div id="collapseThree" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="card-body">
      Having a building with 1000 floor, would take a very long time to reach the top floor from the
first floor. I assume that there are a lot of people occupying this building. So what I would do is to install
many elevators, around 100 elevators. The plan is to have 50 elevators going from 1 – 500 and the other
half would go 500 – 1000.<br><br>
	  For the first half I would have the elevators work similarly to what we have in
APC, stopping at odd and even floors. So for the first 25 it would go: 1, 3, 5, 7….. 499, and the other 255
would go: 2, 4, 6, 8….. 500. This to ensure that there are stopping at every floor because it would be
time consuming. For the other 50, you can ride it from the first floor, but you will immediately be at 500,
you will not stop at any floor other than 500.<br><br>
	  The system will be implemented, the first 25 will be 500,
502, 504…. 1000 and the other 25 is: 501, 503, 505…. 999. I would have the elevators be at the same
speed as the other tall buildings in the world. A building called Taipei 101 have their elevators at the
speed of 60 km/h or 1010 m/s. It can take people from 5 th to 89 th floor in around 37 seconds. Given that,
I would want the elevators to run at a similar speed. Since the elevator can either be used for a company
or a hotel or an apartment, I would want it to move fast and not waste anyone’s time when using the
elevator.<br><br>
For the buttons, I would want it to be a touch screen, like phones, since it is a 1000 floor
building, I would assume it the be technologically advance. The buttons will range from 0 – 9 and a
person must enter their desired floor. The screen will also have the emergency button and the close and
open door of the elevator.
