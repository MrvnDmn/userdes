	  The first week of User Design was not what I expected, there were a lot more on the essay works rather than I expected.
	  It’s not just what I had in mind when entering the first week, I thought there would be more programming.
	  I get why we had to that, for me at least, it teaches me the basic concept of design, conceptualizing the idea without having to code it,
	  which may change because there are some errors that might interfere with design that I had in mind.

	  The 2<sup>nd</sup> week of USERDES class was more fun than the previous week. Especially when we are
working on designing a website and/or an app. It was something that I really find enjoyable at
programming, designing, especially when I was able to work with others and see their views on design.
We did this activity on the topic of Paper Prototyping. We also got to use the Microsoft Room which was
different than usual.
<br><br>
For the topic of need finding, I was able to understand that you can’t just make an app or
website or a device just instantly because you think it’s a good idea. You need to cater the needs of
others. You need to answer the “who’s going to use it”, “why would they use it”, “what is the purpose of
it”. There are no steps to skip and you need to carefully think out a plan to execute. The videos that was
shown explained the topic of Need Finding, especially the video about the shopping cart.

	  For the third week, I quite enjoyed the entire website developing process. HTML was the
language that really pushed me to take the Computer Science course. So, going back to the language
again was fun. I must admit I did forget a lot about the language that’s why I was having a little trouble
when programming the blog site. 
<br><br>
For the website that I created it was quite a boring and plain site.
There’s not really much interaction with user, it’s a simple “read only” blog. I do plan on adding more to
the site as it is required.
<br><br>
Probably the most confusing part of the week was when we were submitting
the website. We used Heroku and Github, which I am not familiar with, and there was a bit of trouble
when submitting, which was easily resolved, we just have to change the HTML to PHP, but when I was
submitting mine, I had no idea how to connect the Github and Heroku and to properly launch the my
project to Heroku, but I was shown how to do it, and I feel stupid not knowing something that is quite
simple.

	  We had to take a “UX Quiz”, it was this annoying test website with a lot of difficult and poorly
designed website. The game was annoying because there were a lot of simple things that will you miss,
and it will affect the entire quiz. That’s what made the site annoying, you think that you might be
finished but you click or type something and everything is changed. That annoying part is what also what
made the website fun in some way, there was a timer and you can see how well you got through the
entire site.
